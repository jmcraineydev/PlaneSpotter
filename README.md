_This is being created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis, and is currently under initial development_

**PlaneSpotter** is an app for those who enjoy plane spotting at a hobby. The idea behind this app to track particular aircraft that you would like to get notifications on when it will be inboud at an airport near you.

## Users Experience

The premise of this app allows users to track aircraft more easily using an aircrafts tail number (registration number) as opposed to an airlines flight number. Users can create an account in PlaneSpotter, see a list of aircraft they are following with flight details, and also see those aircraft marked on a map.

### Development Restrictions

At this time **PlaneSpotter** is restricted to aircraft that carry the US or Japan flag. The database is currently fix while in development. As this application moves closer to production, live tracking will be implemented.
