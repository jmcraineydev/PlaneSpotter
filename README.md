**PlaneSpotter** is an app for those who enjoy plane spotting at a hobby. The idea behind this app to track particular aircraft that you would like to get notifications on when it will be inbound at an airport near you.

## **Users Experience**

The premise of this app allows users to track aircraft more easily using an aircrafts tail number (registration number) as opposed to an airlines flight number. Users can create an account in PlaneSpotter, see a list of aircraft they are following with flight details, and also see those aircraft marked on a map.
